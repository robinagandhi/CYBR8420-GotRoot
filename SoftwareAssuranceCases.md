## Team Reflections
| Issue | Description | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Communication | We identified communication to be a root issue in our success in working as a team. A primary contributor to this issue is the variety of platforms that we use to communicate. Between in-person, email, Slack, and Github, we find ourselves having both redundant and disjointed conversations. This ultimately leads to wasted time as we try to recover context from previous and ongoing communications. | We determined that we would benefit most from choosing a central channel through which we communicate. Moving forward, Slack may prove to be our best option, as it avoids the issue of multi-threadded conversations (email) and also has convenient integrations with Github. |
| Task Management | Tasks for each milestone, while documented in distinct Github Projects, have not been used in a way that clearly facilitate team responsibilities. We have found that this complicates our workflow and requires frequent status updates from team members regarding the tasks they are working on. Poor task management has contributed to a tendency to start work close to deadlines. | Github Issues have features that we can leverage to better organize the work that goes into each milestone. Beyond simply 'assigning' tasks, there should be discussion of the status of work contributing to particular tasks. Additionally, we should leverage the ability to reference pull-requests in Issues to give more purpose and clarification to what we are delivering for each task and when we are delivering it. |
| Availability | As in any working situation, we have found that our varying availabilities challenge our ability to work 'in sync' on certain tasks. This issue is compounded by inefficient communication and poor task management. | Availability problems can likely be solved by communicating more effectively. We can also benefit from having more face-to-face working sessions, when possible. |
| Tooling | As a team, we have had minor issues with the collaborative features offered by some software that we've utilized for this project. Early challenges with Github were clearly due to a lack of experience with the tool, but Lucidchart has posed some issues that we have yet to resolve. | With Lucidchart, specifically, we are attempting to work in a central document with multiple pages to ensure that all of our work is being done in a single location. We will continue with this strategy moving forward. |
