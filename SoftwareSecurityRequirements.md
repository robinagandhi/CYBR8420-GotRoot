# Requirements for Software Security Engineering

## Backstory

NOTE: Scope is open for discusion 

Bitwarden is an open-source online password management service. This software has  earned a good reputation for security as all sensitive information is encypted client side before it is sent to online vault and is recoverable by only using the master password supplied by the end user. In other words, if the end user forgets their master password, the items encypted in the vault will not be recoverable. This software supports a multitude of client applications and devices that all can be used to sync to the online vault. Although the software is free, some features  are only availraibe with premimum accounts and/or family/commercial plans. Due to price, security and featuresi like 2 facore atuh., data sharing, etc.. this software has appeal to both the indivual user as well as commerical businesses as well. 

Since the majority of our focus will be client side since that is where the majority of the security features are implemented. As meentoined above, this software supoorts several platforms and we will be primarliy focused on hte commmand line client but make look at desktop and browser externsions if we feel there may be something uniqute to those clients worth persuing. Mobile devcices will be outside the scope of this evaaluation howeever. 


## Essential Data Flows: 

### 1. Manage master password / encryption key 

#### Use Case

User is prompted for master password when Bitwarden account is created online or on-perm "web vault" via browser. User should create strong password following suggestoin at time of creation. (User should verify email account before adding sensitive data to vault. Does it allow you to add data withour verifying) Encryption key is derived from master password using PBKDF2 SHA-256 using a standard libbrary.  User can update master password at any time, however encyrptoin key will not be regenerated by default. End user can elect to to regenerate encryption if they feel key may have been compromised. All clients should log out and log in prior to adding any data so that it syncs new key. Failure to do this may result in corruptoin.

#### Misuse Case / Security Requirements

weak passwords, library, new keys are not regenerated with change of master password, curruption issues with syncing of new master key
