# Requirements for Software Security Engineering

## Backstory

NOTE: Scope is open for discusion 

Bitwarden is an open-source online password management service. This software has  earned a good reputation for security as all sensitive information is encypted client side before it is sent to online vault and is recoverable by only using the master password supplied by the end user. In other words, if the end user forgets their master password, the items encypted in the vault will not be recoverable. This software supports a multitude of client applications and devices that all can be used to sync to the online vault. Although the software is free, some features  are only availraibe with premimum accounts and/or family/commercial plans. Due to price, security and featuresi like 2 facore atuh., data sharing, etc.. this software has appeal to both the indivual user as well as commerical businesses as well. 

Since the majority of our focus will be client side since that is where the majority of the security features are implemented. As meentoined above, this software supoorts several platforms and we will be primarliy focused on hte commmand line client but make look at desktop and browser externsions if we feel there may be something uniqute to those clients worth persuing. Mobile devcices will be outside the scope of this evaaluation howeever. 


## Essential Data Flows: 

### 1. Manage master password / encryption key 

### Use Case

When end user first creates their account, they are prompted to create a master password. Encryption key is then derived from master password using a strong encryption key derivation fucntion.  

End user can update master password at any time, however that will not automatically result in derivation of new encypton key. End user will be given the option to derive new encryption key with new master password if they feel encryption key may be at risk of compromise. wish to do so.  end user wishes to have a new encryption key derived from new password they cafears current master password and encryption key needcregenerated by default when . End user can elect to to regenerate encryption if they feel key may have been compromised. 

### Misuse Case / Security Requirements

The software should ensure all communcation between client and server is encrypted to protect against network evesdropping.

The software should provde password validation to ensure that chosen master password meets minimum requirements and is concsidered a strong password. This will protect against brute force attenpts on master password.  

The software should ensure that the algorithm used to derive encryption key from master password and its implementation are considered strong and have been publically vetted to protect against reveresal attacks.

In the event the encryption key is changed, the software should be prevent clients from using old encryption key to encrypt sensitive data as it will in corrupted data. 


### Alignment of Security Requirements

Bitwarden encrypts all sensitive data client side and only connnects to online service over a TLS socket.

Bitwarden does have a password validation tool however it is only suggestive, therefore an end user will be allowed to use a weak master password.

Bitwarden the PBKDF2 SHA-256 algorithm for password derived encryption key algorithm. It uses open libraries and meet current industry standards for its implementation.

Bitwarden will try to log out any clients that still are connected to server however it strongly reccomemended that the user log out and in of any clients when changing encrytption key. Failure to do so may result in data curruption.
